# KWB Website

A new webiste for KWB Grasheide using Angular.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically
 reload if you change any of the source files. Make sure you have the [KWB APP](https://github.com/jonasliekens/KWB-App) running in the 
 background on `localhost:5000` ;)

## Build

Build a production version with `ng build -prod`. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
